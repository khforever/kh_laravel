<h1>Conact Us</h1>

Contact Us Page Best Practices
Great contact forms typically:

Are easy to find, so a visitor can quickly get in touch with you.
Explain why someone should contact your business.
Describe how your business can help solve the visitors' problems.
Include an email and phone number so visitors can get in touch with you on their first attempt.
Include a short form using fields that'll help your business understand who's contacting them.
Have a call-to-action to provide visitors with another action to take if they choose not to complete the form.
Leverage key contact form design elements — like user-friendly layouts and clear formatting — to create the optimal user experience for visitors.
Showcase the company's thought leadership, whether by including a list of recent blog posts or articles about the company in the press.
Link to active social media accounts like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn to give visitors another way to engage with the business.
Redirect to a thank you page that explains when and how you'll be contacting the visitor.
Promote helpful content and resources.
Are creative and memorable, allowing visitors to associate contacting your brand with a positive or funny memory.
Show off what your brand does so visitors and potential customers can get a sense of the work you do before they even get in touch.
Avoid unnecessary fields and words, so your page remains as straightforward as possible — no fluff.
Now that we've gone over best practices let's review examples of some of the most effective Contact Us pages on the Internet.

Time to get inspired.

Contact Us Header Examples
An effective Contact Us page typically starts with a catchy header. This draws the visitor in and encourages them to utilize your support offers.

Read on for a few examples of companies that have awesome headers on their contact page.

1. Brandaffair

This Contact Us page is for a marketing agency that works directly with businesses. Since it knows its audience, Brandaffair encourages visitors to "have a talk" one-on-one rather than providing a one-way communication channel via support resources.

Why this "Contact Us" page stands out:
Aside from the obvious pink flamingo, Brandaffair captures the visitor's attention with three methods of communication. The map provides the exact location of the office, the "Meet Us" section includes a phone number and email for general inquiries, and the "Pitch Us" section includes a template that helps businesses submit their ideas directly to the company for consideration.

2. Yummygum

Yummygum is an Amsterdam-based design studio that specializes in digital products made by startups. It's no surprise that this brand's Contact Us page balances both form and function flawlessly.

Why this "Contact Us" page stands out:
As an avid coffee drinker, I can deeply relate to this particular header. Aside from that, this is a friendly and inviting message that gets right to the point for the visitor. It shows where the company is located on one side of the page, as well as how you can contact them on the other side of the page.

3. JetBlue

On this simple, but helpful Contact Us page, JetBlue provides a short-list of hyperlinks to help the user navigate the page. The number of options isn't overwhelming, but there are enough of them to pinpoint exactly what the visitor might be looking for.

Why this "Contact Us" page stands out:
JetBlue's header creates a sense of urgency for the visitor. This is nice because people visiting this page are likely looking for answers quickly — especially if they're troubleshooting an issue right before a flight.

4. IMPACT

If you're looking for a sales-oriented approach, you can use this one from IMPACT's Contact Us page. It gets the sales process moving right away by encouraging users to enter their email address to learn more about the company and its offers.

Why this "Contact Us" page stands out:
This Contact Us page does two things well: it asks for only the information that is necessary (email address) and it displays a video that explains exactly how contacting the IMPACT team works. This is a helpful experience for the user especially if they are expecting a quick response.

5. Unbounce

Unbounce’s Contact Us page places the header front and center for the user. It’s welcoming and accounts for all types of support inquiries including both customer support and marketing partnerships.

Why this "Contact Us" page stands out:
Visitors who land on Unbounce's Contact Us page don't have to sift through loads of information to find what they need. By choosing from just four options, they're likely to find the team they need to get in touch with quickly.
